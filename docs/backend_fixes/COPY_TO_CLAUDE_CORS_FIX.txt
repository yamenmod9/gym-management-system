I have a Flask API on PythonAnywhere that's being blocked by CORS when accessed from my Flutter web app.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Backend: https://yamenmod91.pythonanywhere.com/api
- Flutter web app: http://localhost:xxxxx
- Error: CORS policy blocking requests
- Desktop/mobile apps work fine (no CORS)

THE ERROR:
"Access to XMLHttpRequest has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present"

WHAT I NEED:
1. How to install flask-cors
2. Exact code to add CORS to my Flask app
3. Configuration for PythonAnywhere
4. Support for:
   - All origins (dev) or specific origins (prod)
   - Authorization header (JWT tokens)
   - Content-Type: application/json
   - Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS

MY FLASK APP STRUCTURE:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required

app = Flask(__name__)
jwt = JWTManager(app)

@app.route('/api/subscriptions/activate', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
def activate_subscription():
    # logic here
    return jsonify({"status": "success"})
```

REQUIREMENTS:
- Must work with PythonAnywhere
- Must support preflight OPTIONS requests
- Must allow JWT Authorization header
- Easy to enable/disable

Please provide:
1. pip install command
2. Import statement
3. Code to add to Flask app
4. PythonAnywhere-specific config (if needed)
5. How to test it works

Make it production-ready but allow all origins for now (I'll restrict later).
